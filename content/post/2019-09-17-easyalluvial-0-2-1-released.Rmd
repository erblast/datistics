`easyalluvial` allows you to build exploratory alluvial plots (sankey diagrams) with a single line of code while automatically binning numerical variables. This releas `0.2.1` ensures `tidyr 1.0.0` compatibility and fixes a bug around categorical variables for model response plots

# Model Response Plots with Categorical Variables

This feature had som glitches before as edvardoss reported in this [issue](https://github.com/erblast/easyalluvial/issues/13). If anybody else encounters some glitches or inconcistencies please report them as well.

We create a grid of all possible feature combinations and use an alluvial plot to visualise the model response.

Learn more about this feature in this [previous blog post](https://www.datisticsblog.com/2019/04/visualising-model-response-with-easyalluvial/)

```{r }

suppressPackageStartupMessages( require(tidyverse) )
suppressPackageStartupMessages( require(easyalluvial) )

```

```{r fig.height = 9, fig.width=12, cache=T}

df = titanic %>%
  select_if(is.factor)

set.seed(0)
m = randomForest::randomForest( Survived ~ ., df)
imp = m$importance
dspace = get_data_space(df, imp, degree = 3)
pred = predict(m, newdata = dspace,type = 'response')


p = alluvial_model_response(pred, dspace, imp, degree = 3)

grid = add_marginal_histograms(p, plot = F, data_input = df) 
grid = add_imp_plot(grid = grid, p = p, data_input = df, plot = T)

```
