`easyalluvial` allows you to build exploratory and interactive alluvial plots (sankey diagrams) with a single line of code while automatically binning numerical variables. This release `0.2.3` ensures `dplyr 1.0.0` compatibilitiy and now builds a slick pkgdown documentation website and makes better use of `Travis CI` using multiple builds to test compatibility with development versions of selected package dependencies.

# New 'pkgdown' Documentaion 

If I knew how easy it was to create a `pkgdown` documentation website I would have done it long time ago. The `easyalluvial` documentation used to consist of only the `README.md` file with links to blogposts that would contain more detailed tutorials. Now everything can be found in one place. 

[https://erblast.github.io/easyalluvial/](https://erblast.github.io/easyalluvial/)

```{r short_screenshot, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("image"
                    , classes = 'center'
                    , src = '../../../screenshot_pkgdown.png'
                    , thumbnail = '../../../screenshot_pkgdown.png'
                    # , `thumbnail-width` = '360px'
                    # , `thumbnail-height` = '360px'
                    , target = 'https://erblast.github.io/easyalluvial/'
                    )

```


# New 'Travis CI' Configuration

```{r short_travis, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("image"
                    , classes = 'center'
                    , src = 'https://annakrystalli.me/talks/assets/travis.png'
                    , thumbnail = 'https://annakrystalli.me/talks/assets/travis.png'
                    , `thumbnail-width` = '120px'
                    , `thumbnail-height` = '120px'
                    , target = 'https://travis-ci.org/'
                    )

```


The real change however, is that I am now making better use of `Travis CI`. I made it a habit to develop in a designated branch and use pull requests to merge with the master branch. `Travis CI` now controls the merge of the pull request only allowing it if all checks in all builds have passed. In addition to simply running package checks `Travis CI` now uses multiple parallel builds. One build each for `R-release` and `R-devel` and a couple of more for checking compatibility with development versions of selected tidyverse dependencies. Another build checks the reverse dependency `parcats`.

Even cooler `Travis CI` is setup to build the `pkgdown` website and publishes it immediately to a separate github pages branch. So me forgetting to build the website before commiting to github will not effect the documentation. There is a great [blogpost](https://www.r-bloggers.com/continuous-deployment-of-package-documentation-with-pkgdown-and-travis-ci/) with instruction on how to set-up `Travis CI` to deploy github pages.

Since I set up many parallel builds in different environments I only want one of them to render the documentation. Therefore I created an environment variable `PKGDOWN` which is set to `yes` in only one of the builds and set to `no` in the others. The deploy section will only run if `PKGDOWN=yes` on the master branch.

For R-packages the script section of each build is pre-configured. In order to integrate the building of the `pkgdown` website into the script part of the `r-release` build I had to overwrite it. Which required me to also add commands for installing package dependencies and running package checks.

This is the content of the final `.travis.yml`
```
