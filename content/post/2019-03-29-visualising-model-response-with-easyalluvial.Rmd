In this tutorial I want to show how you can use alluvial plots to visualise model response in up to 4 dimensions. `easyalluvial` generates artificial data space using fixed values for unplotted variables or uses the partial dependence plotting method. It is model agnostic but offers some convenient wrappers for `caret` models.

# Introduction

## Taking a peek

When building machine learning model we are usually faced with a trade-off between accurracy and interpretability. However even if we tend to lean towards accuracy and pick a modelling method that results in nearly uninterpretable models we can still make use of a bunch of model agnostic techniques that have been summarized in this excellent ebook
