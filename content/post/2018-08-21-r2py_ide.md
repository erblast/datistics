# Introduction

Before I started with `R` I used to do quite a lot of `python` coding, however back in the days I was still using `python 2.7` and was not really using a bona-fide data-centric workflow. In this series of notebooks I would like to document how my best-practices from using `R` can be carried over to the `python` universe.

# IDE

`R` has with `RStudio` one obvious candidate for the best IDE to use with `R`. It has been developed just like `R` especially for maintaining a data-centric workflow. We have

- plotting
- interactive variable exploration
- `git` integration
- code completion
- code documentation
- package building
- unit testing
- markdown support
- package and reproducibility management
- execution of `python` code

`python` on the other hand has not been primarily developed for data science applications but has some great add-onn packages that can be used for scientific computation. There are a couple of `python` IDE that mimick the `RStudio` or the `Matlab` interface such as `spyder` and `rodeo` they support plotting and interactive variable exploration and have great code completion but they lack `git` and markdown support. The multi-purpose IDE `pycharm` however seems to support also the other features that `RStudio` is capable of. The professional version offers a `scientific mode` that also mimicks the `RStudio`interface to some degree and that provides a decent project structure.

Here we will walk through the features mentioned above and see how they are implemented in `pycharm`

## Ploting and interactive variable exploration

This requirement is fullfilled by all IDEs.

## `git` integration

`git` integration is pretty straight forward with more options than in RStudio

## Code Completion
Code completion in `RStudio` is pretty straight forward if you press <kbd>Tab</kbd> your namespace is sensibly searched for variables and functions that you might be typing. When you are typing a function it automatically displays the function documentation and which parameters the function is accepting. When you are defining the parameters of a function and you hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> `RStudio` will show you a list of all parameters of the function that you have not defined yet. You can then select the parameter from the list  In `python` code completion is done by packages like `jedi` which seems to be what all the IDEs are using however code completion feels a bit different. `spyder`'s code completion looks and works exactly like the one of `RStdio`. `pycharm` has code completion but it tends to be cluttered with irrelevant object and method names when it does not find anything in the local namespace. In order to get the parameters of the function we also have to use an additional shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (on windows). This only displays the parameter but we cannot select anything and thus have to type it ourselves.

## Code Documentation
In `R` we can only document functions properly when writing a package using `roxygen2` comments. We can call the documentation of a function using `?` for example: `?myfunction()`. This will display nicely as `html` in an additional viewer window. In order to generate consistent `roxygen2` comments we can use the `sinew` package which will generate a sensible template from a finished function. Code examples can be copy pasted into the console or can be called via `example()`

In python we can use `help(myfunction)` or `my_function.__doc__` to call the docstring associated with a function as console output.  In `pycharm` we can place the caret inside the name of any function and press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> in order to obtain a more well formated pop-up window containing the docstring.

The docstring in `python` can be written for any function and also makes sense outside of package writing. In `pycharm` we can insert a docstring template in any definition of a function by placing the caret in the function name of the definition and hit <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> to get to a menu in which one option is to insert a docstring template based on the parameters of the function.

There is a google style sheet for writing docstrings. [link](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)

Example code in the docstring should be started with `>>>>` and the line below should reflect the return value

```

>>>> len('foo')
3
```

Those examples can be run as unit tests by packages such as `doctest`, `nose` or `unittests`

[see this blogpost](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/python/how-to-write-effective-docstrings)

## Package Building
package building and installation is very well integrated in `RStudio`, there is a steep learning curve but we can compile doumentation run tests and check all from within `Rstudio` and we have several option to create `latex`,`pdf` or `html` documentation.

In `python` package building seems to be pretty straight forward. you basically just need a ` __init__.py` file in your directory and you have a package.

But there are some standards and nomenclature best practices that are described [here](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html).

## Unit Testing
In `R` we use `testthat` and the integrated `RStudio` build tools to write and execute unit tests. In `python` the standard package seems to be `unittest` while there are a number of different packages for unit testing with a simpler synthax such as `py.test`. As already mentioned `doctest` will run python examples in your docstring. 

See this [blogpost](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/) for more information.

## Package Management and Code Reproducibility
Code reproducibililty and portability is a big issue in `R` since there are so many packages that are constantly updated it is hard to track the dependencies for a specific analysis. `Rstudio` relies on `packrat` to ensure reproducibilty by saving all packages with each analysis or project which greatly increases the diskspace needed for a project. To tackle this I have actually written a package called (`updateR`)[https://github.com/erblast/updateR] resorting to a workflow where I archive `R` and all packages installed at this timepoint 4 times a year.

In `python` we seem to have different options. We can use `pip freeze` to create a `requirements.txt` file. We can use an `anaconda` environment which we can share with our analyis or we can use `docker`. All three options seem to be well supported by `pycharm`.

## Markdown Support
`RStudio` and markdown go hand in hand. `.Rmd` are similar to `.md` files and can contain executable code chunks in either `R` or `python` and can be rendered into numereous formats such as word, slides, dashboards, `html`, ebooks, `pdf` and blogposts. `.Rmd` files are simple text files that contain a `YAML` header that defines the rendering options. `RStudio` even supports
one click publishing of `html` content to `Rpubs` a publication platform for `R` code.

The `python` equivalent is `jupyter notebook` which uses the `.ipynb` format which is basically a `json` file. The `json` format does not easily display in a text editor so we always have to use an IDE of some sort to edit those files. The best method is to start a `jupyter notebook` kernel from the command line and connect to it via a web browser. This starts an easy to use webinterface that allows for editing `.ipynb` files and feels a bit like a `.Rmd` editing in `RStudio`. We have different cells and we can define the content of this cell as either being markdown or code of a variety of languages and we can see the output of the code being console output or a plot right below the cells. Pretty much the same as it is with `RStudio`.

The difference is in the file format, the `Rmd` format does not save any code output inside the file while `.ipynb` even stores binary information inside the document. This makes the changes in `.ipynb` files difficult to track for `git` and practically disqualifies them from being part of an entire analysis or deployment process. We can use `Rmd` files as actual bulding blocks of an entire analysis for which we can have `html` reporting for each steps that can be legible to none-coders. The use-case for `jupyter notebook` seems to be documentation of data exploration, tutorials or proof of concepts.

As far as I can tell we can edit `.ipynb` files inside `pycharm` but I had difficulties saving the changes that I had made to the notebooks and ended up loosing a lot of work. It seems as if in `pycharm` we need at least one code cell to save the file. I am more comfortable now working with the `jupyter notebook` webinterface.

## Execution of foreign code
In `RStudio` we can use the `reticulate` package to execute `python` code and to convert `python` into `R` objects. We can also define `python` chunks inside `Rmd` documents. However we can only get `python` code completion or interactive variable exploration when we convert the `python` objects to `R` objects.

Both `pycharm` and `jupyter notebook` support R. We can probably use `feather` to pass dataframes between `R` and `python`.
