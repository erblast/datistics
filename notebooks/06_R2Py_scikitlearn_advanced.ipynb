    "We have seen in the last document, some advantages of `scikitlearn`. Most notably the seamless integration of parallel processing. I was struggeling a bit with the fact that `scikitlearn` only accepts `numpy` arrays as input and I was missing the `recipes` package which makes initial data transformation in `R` so much easier. Then I stumbled upon `sklearn-pandas` which seamlessly integrates `pandas` with `sklearn` and supports a pipe based workflow, which is a `sklearn` feaure I have not started to explore yet. To my understanding the pipe workflow in `sklearn` is an object-oriented pythonic version of the modelling dataframe concept introduced by the `tidyverse` in `R`. Finally there are packages like `TPOT` and `auto-sklearn` which automate the whole thing.\n",

    "# To sparse or not to sparse\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `python` data world data is considered to be *sparse* or *dense*. Which adresses the number of zeros in a matrix [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix). *sparse* means that you have a lot of them while *dense* means the opposite. There is no particular threshold but we should be aware that some data transformatios like dummy encoding make our data more *sparse*. A *sparse* matrix can be stored in a more memory efficient format such similar as a compressed image file and some algorithms can computationally leaverage this format to reduce computing time. [lasso](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_lasso_dense_vs_sparse_data.html) and [boosting gradient style algorithms](https://medium.com/sbc-group-blog/to-sparse-or-not-to-sparse-691483f87a53) seem to be able to profit from the sparse data format while others [neural nets, knn](https://medium.com/sbc-group-blog/to-sparse-or-not-to-sparse-691483f87a53) do not, and some like [randomForest](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28384680/scikit-learns-pipeline-a-sparse-matrix-was-passed-but-dense-data-is-required) require the regular dense format and will otherwise raise an error. We can use `SciPy` to transform matrices to a dense format. We can measure the sparcity ratio as follows\n"
